## About

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

I'm a junior at Wuhan University (Chinese Language & Literature + Communication Studies minor), currently seeking AI Product Manager internships. This site documents my product thinking, AI experiments, and research work — including both successes and intentional failure cases.
